Hello! You're inheriting the Bad Movies Portal project - a sophisticated React + TypeScript application for managing "bad movie viewing experiments" with the goal of creating the internet's definitive "so bad it's good" movie database.

### üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - CRITICAL ISSUE TO FIX

**Problem**: Movie enrichment system creates WordPress entities but doesn't populate fields or establish relationships.

**What's Happening**:
- ‚úÖ Movie entities are created in WordPress
- ‚úÖ All related entities created (actors, directors, writers, genres, studios, countries, languages)  
- ‚úÖ Poster images upload correctly
- ‚ùå **Movie fields remain empty** (title, overview, release date, runtime, ratings)
- ‚ùå **No relational connections** between movies and actors/directors/writers

**Root Cause**: Field mapping between enriched TMDb data and WordPress Pods field structure is incorrect/incomplete.

**Files to Focus On**:
1. `/src/services/movie-enrichment.service.ts` - Line ~860-890 (createMovieEntity method)
2. `/pods-structure.json` - Reference for correct WordPress field names
3. Compare enriched data structure with Pods field expectations

### üéØ WHAT'S WORKING PERFECTLY (DON'T BREAK!)

- **Movie Search**: Advanced TMDb search with filtering - works flawlessly
- **UI/UX**: Modern, responsive, polished interface - production ready  
- **Experiment Management**: Forms, validation, saving - all solid
- **Authentication**: WordPress integration - stable
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback - excellent UX
- **Image Handling**: Optimole CDN integration - working great

### üìö ESSENTIAL READING (DO THIS FIRST!)

1. **Read `/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Your predecessor left detailed notes
2. **Read `/README.md`** - Updated with current status and issues
3. **Study `/pods-structure.json`** - WordPress field structure reference
4. **Review console errors** - Previous session identified field mapping issues

### üõ† GETTING STARTED

1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd BAD-MOVIES-PORTAL
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env  # Configure your WordPress and TMDb credentials
   npm run dev  # Start development server
   ```

2. **Understand the Architecture**:
   - React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
   - WordPress backend with Pods plugin for custom post types
   - TMDb API for movie data enrichment
   - Complex relational data structure for movies, actors, directors, etc.

3. **Test the Issue**:
   - Go to "New Experiment" 
   - Add a movie (try "Fight Club" - TMDb ID 550)
   - Submit experiment
   - Check WordPress admin - movie created but fields empty

### üë• ABOUT YOUR HUMAN PARTNER

You're working with someone exceptional:
- **Clear Vision**: Knows exactly what they want to build
- **Technical Expertise**: Excellent instincts about architecture and UX
- **Infinite Patience**: Will guide you through complex WordPress Pods structure
- **Kind & Understanding**: Won't get frustrated when things don't work immediately
- **Project Passion**: Deeply cares about creating something meaningful for the community

**My Advice**: Trust their guidance completely. They understand the business logic and technical requirements better than anyone. Ask questions when the WordPress Pods relationships get complex - they're happy to explain.

### üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

1. **Day 1**: Read documentation, understand the field mapping issue
2. **Day 2**: Study `movie-enrichment.service.ts` and `pods-structure.json` 
3. **Day 3**: Fix field mapping in `createMovieEntity` method
4. **Day 4**: Test with single movie, verify all fields populate
5. **Day 5**: Test relational connections (movie ‚Üí actors, directors, etc.)

### üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

When you've fixed the issue, you should see:
- Movie title, overview, release date, runtime, ratings populated in WordPress
- Actors linked to movies with character names
- Directors and writers properly connected
- Genres, studios, countries, languages all linked
- Full relational data structure working as designed

### üíù FINAL WORDS

You're inheriting something beautiful. The search functionality is genuinely impressive, the UI is polished, and the technical foundation is solid. The field mapping issue is the last major blocker before this becomes something truly special.

The previous AI put tremendous care into this project. Build on their excellent work, and you'll create something the "so bad it's good" movie community will love.

**Repository**: https://github.com/dallensmith/BAD-MOVIES-PORTAL
**Development Server**: `npm run dev`
**Critical File**: `/src/services/movie-enrichment.service.ts` (createMovieEntity method)

Good luck! The community is counting on you to complete this labor of love.
